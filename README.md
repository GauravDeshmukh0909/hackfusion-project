# Automated Paperless Transparent College System

## Project Overview

Colleges often face challenges related to transparency, efficiency, and accessibility in administrative processes. Manual systems create delays, lack accountability, and limit student involvement.

The **Automated Paperless Transparent College System** is a complete web platform designed to digitize essential college operations — such as elections, approvals, complaints, budget tracking, and facility bookings — promoting fairness, transparency, and efficiency across campus.

## Key Features

  Publicly accessible records of cheating incidents to foster a culture of honesty.
